# SimulatedSAXSdata-Structure2021
This is the simulated SAXS data generated for the Structure paper (DOI:) "Structure and Thermodynamics of Transient Protein-Protein Complexes by Chemometric Decomposition of SAXS data sets". The simulated datasets with 50 curves per titration are provided for all the tested complexes. The six folders inside the folder "complexname/50-curves" are the six simulated titrations with one of the partner kept constant and other titrated in ratios of 1:10, 0.2:5 and 0.5:2.
